   abstractNote={Bacteriophage MS2 RNA is 3,569 nucleotides long. The nucleotide sequence has been established for the third and last gene, which codes for the replicase protein. A secondary structure model has also been proposed. Biological properties, such as ribosome binding and codon interactions can now be discussed on a molecular basis. As the sequences for the other regions of this RNA have been published already, the complete, primary chemical structure of a viral genome has now been established.},

  title={Density-based binning of gene clusters to infer function or evolutionary history using GeneGrouper},
  volume={38},
  ISSN={1367-4803},
  DOI={10.1093/bioinformatics/btab752},
  abstractNote={Abstract Motivation Identifying variant forms of gene clusters of interest in phylogenetically proximate and distant taxa can help to infer their evolutionary histories and functions. Conserved gene clusters may differ by only a few genes, but these small differences can in turn induce substantial phenotypes, such as by the formation of pseudogenes or insertions interrupting regulation. Particularly as microbial genomes and metagenomic assemblies become increasingly abundant, unsupervised grouping of similar, but not necessarily identical, gene clusters into consistent bins can provide a population-level understanding of their gene content variation and functional homology. Results We developed GeneGrouper, a command-line tool that uses a density-based clustering method to group gene clusters into bins. GeneGrouper demonstrated high recall and precision in benchmarks for the detection of the 23-gene Salmonella enterica LT2 Pdu gene cluster and four-gene Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 Mex gene cluster among 435 genomes spanning mixed taxa. In a subsequent application investigating the diversity and impact of gene-complete and -incomplete LT2 Pdu gene clusters in 1130 S.enterica genomes, GeneGrouper identified a novel, frequently occurring pduN pseudogene. When investigated in vivo, introduction of the pduN pseudogene negatively impacted microcompartment formation. We next demonstrated the versatility of GeneGrouper by clustering distant homologous gene clusters and variable gene clusters found in integrative and conjugative elements. Availability and implementation GeneGrouper software and code are publicly available at https://pypi.org/project/GeneGrouper/. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
